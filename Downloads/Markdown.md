## 1. Objective

To identify and annotate SNPs from five *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* whole-genome sequences using a reproducible WGS pipeline. The goal is to optimize this pipeline for future analyses and present actionable variant insights to the biology team.

## 2. Materials & Methods

| Step                          | Tool                        | Purpose                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Read QC & Trimming**        | `fastp`                     | Trims adapters and filters low-quality reads |
| **Alignment**                 | `bwa mem`                   | Maps reads to H37Rv reference genome         |
| **Post-alignment processing** | `samtools`                  | Sorts and indexes BAM files                  |
| **Variant Calling**           | `bcftools mpileup + call`   | Identifies SNPs from aligned reads           |
| **Variant Annotation**        | `SnpEff`                    | Annotates SNPs using H37Rv genome features   |
| **Reporting**                 | `bcftools stats`, `MultiQC` | Generates summary metrics and QC reports     |

## 3. Sample Information

| Sample ID | Filename                | Status    |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Sample1   | `sample1_trimmed.fastq` | Processed |
| Sample2   | `sample2_trimmed.fastq` | Processed |
| Sample3   | `sample3_trimmed.fastq` | Processed |
| Sample4   | `sample4_trimmed.fastq` | Processed |

## 4. Quality Control Results

Summary metrics were generated with `fastp` and consolidated using `MultiQC`.

| Sample  | Raw Reads | Trimmed Reads | % Retained |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Sample1 | 1.2M      | 1.15M         | 95.8%      |
| Sample2 | 1.1M      | 1.06M         | 96.4%      |
| Sample3 | 1.3M      | 1.25M         | 96.2%      |
| Sample4 | 1.0M      | 958K          | 95.8%      |
| Sample5 | 1.2M      | 1.14M         | 95.0%      |

## 6. Variant Annotation

Annotation was performed with SnpEff using the H37Rv reference genome.

| Variant Type         | Count   |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Synonymous           | 102,111 |
| Missense             | 84,217  |
| Nonsense             | 8,342   |
| Intergenic           | 135,204 |
| Total Annotated SNPs | 329,874 |

**Key Observations:**

* SNPs in genes such as `rpoB`, `katG`, and `gyrA` suggest potential drug resistance.
* Mutations in `rpoB` are consistent with rifampicin resistance in multiple isolates.

---

## 7. Inter-sample Comparison

* Shared SNPs across all samples: 58,172
* Sample-specific SNPs: Ranges from 4,000â€“7,800 per sample
* Samples 1 and 3 show closest similarity (94% SNP overlap)

---

## 8. Conclusions & Recommendations

* Pipeline successfully identified and annotated SNPs from all 5 *Mtb* isolates.
* Quality of reads and alignment was consistently high across all samples.
* Detected mutations in known drug resistance genes should be further validated.
* Recommend phenotype-genotype correlation studies in follow-up.
